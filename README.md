# phone-rooting
Samsung phones can be rooted no bootloding is needed
Go to recovery mode in Samsung galaxy A50 is see loading
It is sideload so u can sideload magisk.zip on it and u mill have a morking non bootloader unlock phone and root
I did not test that and didn't see people tolk about it so try at your own risk
